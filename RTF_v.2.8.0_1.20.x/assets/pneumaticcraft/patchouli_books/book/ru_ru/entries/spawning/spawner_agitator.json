It changes Spawner internals enough that Spawner Agitators cannot fully interact with them. Since you have Apotheosis installed, Spawner Agitator functionality is limited to preventing mobs despawning when players are far away; to allow mobs to spawn when no players are near, use Apotheosis functionality."
