      "text": "The Regulator Tube Module is an $(l:tubes/tube_modules#inline)inline/$ module used to limit the $(l:base_concepts/pressure)pressure/$ allowed through the tube. By default, the module will regulate the pressure to 4.9 bar (for both basic and advanced tubes) with no redstone signal, reducing toward 0 as the signal rises toward 15. This means a lever right beside a regulator closes it, preventing any air flow through it."

      "text": "When the narrow side of the regulator reaches this pressure, no more air will be allowed through the tube. This principal can be used as a $(thing)transformer/$: on the input (wide) side is high-pressure air, but the Regulator Tube limits the pressure on the output to the threshold pressure.$(p)This allows a lower tier tube network to be safely supplied by a higher-tier network."

You can set a precise threshold in the GUI, or (with the $(bold)Advanced Config/$ checkbox) configure interpolated threshold levels based on the redstone signal. This works exactly like the $(l:tubes/safety_module)Safety Module/$."
